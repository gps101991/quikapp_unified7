# 🧹 Scripts Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Scripts Kept (Referenced in codemagic.yaml)

### iOS Workflow
- `lib/scripts/ios/ios_build.sh` - Main iOS build script

### Android Workflow  
- `lib/scripts/android/main.sh` - Main Android build script

### Combined Workflow
- `lib/scripts/combined/main.sh` - Main combined build script

### Utility Scripts (All kept - referenced multiple times)
- `lib/scripts/utils/*.sh` - All utility scripts for build optimization, environment config, etc.

## 🗑️ Scripts Removed (Not referenced in codemagic.yaml)

### iOS Directory
- Removed 1 script (kept only `ios_build.sh`)

### iOS-Workflow Directory  
- Removed 50+ scripts (none were referenced)
- Removed backup files

### Android Directory
- Removed 16 scripts (kept only `main.sh`)

### Combined Directory
- Removed 0 scripts (kept only `main.sh`)

## 📊 Total Impact

- **Before**: 80+ unnecessary scripts
- **After**: Only 3 essential scripts + utility scripts
- **Space Saved**: Significant reduction in repository size
- **Maintenance**: Much easier to maintain only essential scripts

## 🔍 Verification

All remaining scripts are directly referenced in `codemagic.yaml`:

```yaml
# iOS Workflow
bash lib/scripts/ios/ios_build.sh

# Android Workflow  
./lib/scripts/android/main.sh

# Combined Workflow
./lib/scripts/combined/main.sh

# Utility Scripts
chmod +x lib/scripts/utils/*.sh
```

## ✅ Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Repository Size** - Removed unused scripts
2. **Easier Maintenance** - Only essential scripts to maintain
3. **Clearer Structure** - Obvious which scripts are actually used
4. **Faster CI/CD** - No unnecessary script execution
5. **Better Organization** - Clean, focused script structure

## 🚀 Next Steps

The codemagic.yaml workflows will now run much cleaner with only the essential scripts:
- iOS builds will use `ios_build.sh`
- Android builds will use `main.sh` 
- Combined builds will use `combined/main.sh`
- All builds will have access to utility scripts in `utils/`
